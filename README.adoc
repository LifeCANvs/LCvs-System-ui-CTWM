# CTWM

## Intro

CTWM (Claude's Tab Window Manager) is a **stacking window manager** for the X Window System (X11 / Xorg), originally created by Claude Lecommandeur in 1992. 

It is an extension to twm, with support for multiple virtual screens, and a lot of other goodies.


- use and manage up to 32 virtual screens called workspaces
- swap from one workspace to another by clicking on a button in an optionnal panel of buttons (the workspace manager) or by invoking a function
- customize each workspace by choosing different colors, names and pixmaps for the buttons and background root windows

### Features

Major features of the CTWM window manager include:

* stacking windows
* written in C
* highly customizable
* support for up to 32 virtual desktops
* windows can belong to several workspaces
* a map of your workspaces to move windows quickly between different workspaces
* pinnable and sticky menus
* advanced icon management
* shaped, coloured icons
* multiple icons for clients based on the icon name
* animations: icons, root backgrounds and buttons can optionally be animated
* optional 3D window titles and border (ala Motif)
* XPM and JPEG images
* basic EWMH support (as of 4.0.0)
* backwards-compatibility with twm
* freely usable and distributable under the MIT License
* and more...

### History

In 1987, Tom LeStrange wrote the TWM window manager, which was adopted by the X Consortium as the standard window manager in 1989.

In 1992, Claude Lecommandeur added virtual workspaces inspired by HP's vuewm, and so CTWM was born.
Over the following years, he made further changes himself, as well as integrating improvements from other people who had taken up using it.

In 2003, Claude retired from developing and maintaining CTWM, and passed control of the project to Richard Levitte <levitte@lp.se>.
He oversaw it until 2014, and then passed it on to Matthew Fuller <fullermd@over-yonder.net>, the current maintainer. 

### More info

The sources files were once the twm ones with only workmgr.[ch] added (written
from scratch by Claude Lecommandeur) and minor modifications to some twm files.
Since then much more extensive changes and reorganization have been done, 
so the codebase is now significantly different from the original twm.

If you find bugs in ctwm, or just want to tell us how much you like it,
please send a report to the mailing list.

There is a manual page, which always needs more work (any volunteers?).
Many useful information bits are only in the CHANGES.md file, so do read it.


## Platforms, packages and installing

CTWM is available via the package managers and repositories of many Unix-like systems.

See https://pkgs.org/download/ctwm

- Unix-based, including FreeBSD and NetBSD
- Linux-based systems (distributions) including ALT Linux, Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, Void Linux

### Arch Linux

`sudo pacman -Sy`

`sudo pacman -S ctwm`

### Debian / Ubuntu Linux

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get -y install ctwm`

note: `apt` can be substituted for `apt-get`, or use `nala` to install it

### Fedora Linux

`sudo dnf install ctwm`

### Void Linux

`sudo xbps-install -Su ctwm`


### FreeBSD

FreshPorts https://www.freshports.org/x11-wm/ctwm/

to install the port:
`cd /usr/ports/x11-wm/ctwm/ && make install clean`

to add the package, run one of these commands:
`pkg install x11-wm/ctwm`

`pkg install ctwm`

### NetBSD

Packages Collection (pkgsrc) https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/wm/ctwm/index.html

In 2020, the default window manager of NetBSD was switched to CTWM.

- refer to https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-9.2/ctwm.1 for more info, including configuration options.

If needed to (re)install ctwm, do either of:

install binary package
`pkgin in ctwm`
or
build with pkgsrc
`cd /usr/pkgsrc/wm/ctwm`

`make install`

to make it your default window manager, edit your .xinitrc and change or add the exec instruction on the last line as:
exec ctwm -W   # no '&' here, as at the end of the other lines in .xinitrc

- refer to https://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-x.html

## Building

In the simple case, the defaults should work.
Most modern or semi-modern systems should fall into this.

    funny prompt> make

If you need to add special config, you'll have to pass extra bits to
cmake via an invocation like

    funny prompt> make CMAKE_EXTRAS="-DUSE_XPM=OFF -DM4_CMD=superm4"

Though in more complicated cases it may be simpler to just invoke cmake directly:

    funny prompt> ( cd build ; cmake -DUSE_XPM=OFF -DM4_CMD=superm4 .. )

    funny prompt> make

### Configuration

ctwm is built using CMake, which does its best to root around in your
system to find the pieces the build needs.  Occasionally though you might
have to give it some help, or change the defaults of what features are
expected.

In the common case, the included Makefile will do the necessary
invocations, and you won't need to worry about it; just run a normal
`make ; make install` invocation.  If you need to make alterations
though, you may have to invoke cmake manually and set various params on
the command line (cmake also has various GUI configurators, not covered
here).

The following parameters control configuration/installation locations:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX::
        Where paths are based.  This is a standard cmake var.  Referred to as `$PREFIX` below.

ETCDIR::
        Where ctwm will look for a `system.ctwmrc` to fall back to if it
        doesn't find a per-user config.  Nothing is installed here by default.
        (default: `$PREFIX/etc`)

BINDIR::
        Where the ctwm binary is installed.
        (default: `$PREFIX/bin`)

DATADIR::
        Where run-time data like image pixmaps are installed.
        (default: `$PREFIX/share/ctwm`)

MANDIR::
        Base directory under which manpage dirs like `man1` and `man2` live.
        (default: `$PREFIX/share/man` or `$PREFIX/man`, whichever is found first)

DOCDIR::
        Where non-manpage docs are installed.
        (default: `$PREFIX/share/doc/ctwm`)

EXAMPLEDIR::
        Where various example files get installed.  These include the
        system.ctwmrc that is compiled into ctwm as a fallback.
        (default: `$PREFIX/share/examples/ctwm`)


The following parameters control the features/external libs that are
available.  The defaults can be changed by passing parameters like
`-DUSE_XYZ=OFF` to the cmake command line.

USE_M4::
        Enables use of m4(1) for preprocessing config files at runtime.
        If your m4 is called something other than `m4` or `gm4`, you may
        need to also set M4_CMD to point at it.
        (**ON** by default)

USE_XPM::
        Enables the use of XPM images.  Disable if libxpm isn't present,
        which is just barely possible on very old systems.
        (**ON** by default)

USE_JPEG::
        Enables the use of jpeg images via libjpeg.  Disable if libjpeg isn't present.
        (**ON** by default)

USE_EWMH::
        Enables EWMH support.
        (**ON** by default)

USE_RPLAY::
        Build with sound support via librplay.  `USE_SOUND` is a still
        valid but deprecated alias for this, and will give a warning.
        (**OFF** by default)

USE_XRANDR::
        Enables the use of multi-monitors of different sizes via
        libXrandr.  Disable if libXrandr isn't present or is older than 1.5.
        (**ON** by default)


Additional vars you might need to set:

M4_CMD::
        Name of m4 program, if it's not `m4` or `gm4`, or full path to it
        if it's not in your `$PATH`.


### Required Libs

ctwm requires various X11 libraries to be present.
That list will generally include libX11, libXext, libXmu, libXt, libSM, and libICE.
Depending on your configuration, you may require extra libs as discussed
above (libXpm, libjpeg, and libXrandr are included in the default config).
If you're on a system that separates header files etc. from the
shared lib itself (many Linux dists do), you'll probably need -devel or
similarly named packages installed for each of them as well.

- "We require a compiler with at least basic C99-level capabilities, moderately current POSIX compatibility, and some non-standard but common extensions like getopt_long(3) and asprintf(3)."


### Installation

    funny prompt> make install

### Packaging

The CMake build system includes sufficient info for CPack to be used to
build RPM (and presumably, though not tested, DEB) packages.  As a quick
example of usage:

    funny prompt> make

    funny prompt> (cd build && cpack -G RPM)
